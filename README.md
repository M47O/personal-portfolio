# Personal Portfolio
This website was created to serve as a repository of my projects and offer people a reliable place to get in contact with me. It was a blast to make and taught me a lot about TailwindCSS and mobile-first development in general.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS

Created with HTML and JavaScript and styled entirely with TailwindCSS (and maybe one or two lines of vanilla CSS). JavaScript was used to write event listeners for a hamburger menu on mobile devices, for a toggleable dark mode, the state of which is stored using the localStorage object, and for creating an avatar that is animated upon certain `mouseover` events.

## Lessons Learned:

 * Basic design principles for mobile-first development
 * Configuration of TailwindCSS module
 * Honestly, joke's on me, but I learned about the official Tailwind Intellisense extension for VSCode `(extension id: bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)` for the first time during this project, which made using Tailwind 100x easier
